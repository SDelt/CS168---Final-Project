Modifications:
- fixed the "show_all_balances" function in clients.py
	- The issue was, the gensis block was being passed from blockchain.py::set_genesis_block->client.py::set_genesis_block
	  however, the genesis block was never being saves to the clients own blocks

Changes made in client.py:
	- Added self.blocks.append(block) to set_genesis_block
	- Changes blocks from a dict to a array/list	blocks = []

Change made in blockchain.py and client.py:
	- Added some debugging statements that print for client initialization and genesis block
