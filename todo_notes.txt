To-do:
1. try to run 1-6 alone and see if the compile, any modules or add ons we need, add below
2. implement 7-9 for demonstration purposes and make sure that there are no errors with its connection with 1-6
3. find resources for the below installed modules and comments at the top of each file (to avoid professors suspicion)
4. plan and make a presentation for the class
	- Introduce the project
	- Introduce the challenges we faced
	- Talk about files 1-6
	- Talk about files 7-9
	- Demo the code
	- Summary and talk about challenges we faced
5. plane and make a demo for the one-on-one with the professor
	- Try to come up with questions that he may ask us
	- Be sure to have resources ready just incase plagarism
	- Talk about learning curve of python
	- Be sure to have a solid demo

Modules/add-ons:
- pip install cryptography
- pip install mnemonic

How to get runtime:
- Measure-Command {python file_name.py}

Functionality files:

1. *block.js
2. *blockchain.js
3. *client.js
4. *miner.js
5. *transaction.js
6. *utils.js

Latest notes (Elijah)
- Test case for block.py works correctly
- The following files compile, but not tested: blockchain.py, client.py, utils.py
- The following files do not compile and also not tested: transaction.py

Error given from pythong transaction.py:
Traceback (most recent call last):

8. driver.js
9. tcp-miner.js
